'''OpenGL extension EXT.shader_implicit_conversions

This module customises the behaviour of the 
OpenGL.raw.GLES2.EXT.shader_implicit_conversions to provide a more 
Python-friendly API

Overview (from the spec)
	
	This extension provides support for implicitly converting signed integer
	types to unsigned types, as well as more general implicit conversion and
	function overloading infrastructure to support new data types introduced by
	other extensions.

The official definition of this extension is available here:
http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/EXT/shader_implicit_conversions.txt
